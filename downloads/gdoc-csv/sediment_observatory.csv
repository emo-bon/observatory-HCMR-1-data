Temperature data available from Seafloor Observatory at the maximum depth (sampling rate 5 minutes) and by temperature loggers deployed along the water column (18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8 m depth at hourly time intervals). The Seafloor Observatory at the UBPC comprises a CTD, Fluorometer, and Acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP) which are currently unavailable due to maintenance and scheduled to be redeployed by the end of 2021.Annual phytoplankton blooms occur in spring (March to May).Since UBPC is an experimental platform, research activities are taking place on the seafloor, including experimental sponge cultivation and deployment and monitoring of artificial reefs, deployment and monitoring of ARMS. Artisanal fisheries common in the surroundings but prohibited within the limits of the experimental facility.",Melanthia Stavroulaki,mstavroulaki@hcmr.gr,https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0202-8256,
